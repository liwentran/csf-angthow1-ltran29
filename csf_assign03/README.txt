**MS1**
Implemented all MS1 functions together through side-by-side partner coding. 

**MS2**
Implemented all MS2 functions together through side-by-side partner coding. 

**MS3**
Implemented all MS2 functions together through side-by-side partner coding. 


We will run a variety of tests while holding one factor constant. That way we can thoroughly analyze the effects of each individual factor. 
We will use `./csim 256 4 128 write-allocate write-through  lru < ./traces/swim.trace` our control. That way we can have a reference point for our changes.

We conclude that the more sets we have, the better the performance because it requires less cycles.

We conclude that the more bytes we have, the better the performance because it requires less cycles.


Write allocate vs No write allocate
write allocate:
./csim 256 4 128 write-allocate write-through  lru < ./traces/swim.trace

Total loads: 220668
Total stores: 82525
Load hits: 220374
Load misses: 294
Store hits: 80967
Store misses: 1558
Total cycles: 14480241

no write allocate:
v./csim 256 4 128 no-write-allocate write-through  lru < ./traces/swim.trace
Total loads: 220668
Total stores: 82525
Load hits: 219718
Load misses: 950
Store hits: 70275
Store misses: 12250
Total cycles: 11582493

We conclude that not having write allocate is better for performance because it requires less cycles.

Write through vs Write back
Increase:
./csim 256 4 128 write-allocate write-through  lru < ./traces/swim.trace
Total loads: 220668
Total stores: 82525
Load hits: 220374
Load misses: 294
Store hits: 80967
Store misses: 1558
Total cycles: 14480241


Decrease:
./csim 256 4 128 write-allocate write-back  lru < ./traces/swim.trace
Total loads: 220668
Total stores: 82525
Load hits: 220374
Load misses: 294
Store hits: 80967
Store misses: 1558
Total cycles: 8707741

We conclude that write back is better for performance because it requires less cycles.


LRU vs fifo

LRU:
./csim 256 4 128 write-allocate write-through  lru < ./traces/swim.trace
Total loads: 220668
Total stores: 82525
Load hits: 220374
Load misses: 294
Store hits: 80967
Store misses: 1558
Total cycles: 14480241

FIFO:
./csim 256 4 128 write-allocate write-through fifo < ./traces/swim.trace
Total loads: 220668
Total stores: 82525
Load hits: 220345
Load misses: 323
Store hits: 80960
Store misses: 1565
Total cycles: 14595405

We conclude that LRU is better for performance because it requires less cycles.



From our experiments, we can conclude that best cache will be the one with the most number of sets, blocks, number of bytes per block with no-write-allocate, write-back, and LRU.
